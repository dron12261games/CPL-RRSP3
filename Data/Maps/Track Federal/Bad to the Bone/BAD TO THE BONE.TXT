                          Do you like skeletons? They're so cool, aren't they?

                          If you love kleers from the serious sam series then 
                          this is the map for you. 
                          
                          As resources I took MAYhem 2019.

                          Вам нравятся скелеты? Они такие классные, правда?

                          Если вы любите Клиров из серии "Серьезный Сэм", то 
                          эта карта для вас.

                          В качестве ресурсов я взял MAYhem 2019.
