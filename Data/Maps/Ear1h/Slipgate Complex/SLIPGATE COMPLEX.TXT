Description             : [EN]
                          The neighbouring base has stopped showing signs of
                          life. Your command sent you through the slipgate to
                          take the enemy by surprise.
                          
                          [RU]
                          Соседняя база перестала подавать признаки жизни. 
                          Командование отправило вас через врата, чтобы 
                          застать врага врасплох.
