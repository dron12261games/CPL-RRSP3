Misc. Author Info       : I am a newcomer to doom mapping and what is worse
                          - this is my first speedmapping project. This is
                          the second map in RRSS3 by me.

Description             : [EN]
                          First things first, you should not use freelook,
                          jump, crouch. There is some HEHACKED edits. To 
                          launch properly, you should use a command line 
                          "-hhever 1.3".
                          
                          It means that the proper version of HEHACKED will 
                          be mused. You can just launch the bat file, by 
                          the way.
                          
                          [RU]
                          Прежде всего, вы не должны использовать freelook, 
                          jump, crouch. В игру внесены некоторые правки 
                          HEHACKED. Для правильного запуска следует 
                          использовать командную строку «-hhever 1.3».

                          Это означает, что будет запущена правильная версия 
                          HEHACKED. Кстати, вы можете просто запустить 
                          bat-файл.
