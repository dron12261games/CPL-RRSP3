# Nugget Doom

Nugget Doom is a fork of [Woof!](https://github.com/fabiangreffrath/woof), simply intended to implement additional features.

**Note:** this README and the rest of documentation are updated on a per-commit basis,
meaning that they may not correspond to the latest release of Nugget Doom.
If you're seeking information on the version you're using, please refer to the documentation included with it.

### DISCLAIMER
Although the new code has been written with the intention of not breaking demo compatibility, it has not been properly tested yet.
**RECORD DEMOS AT YOUR OWN RISK!**

## Features

Note that this feature list is relative to [Woof!'s](https://github.com/fabiangreffrath/woof/blob/master/README.md#key-features);
read the latter for more details.
Some features were first implemented in Nugget Doom and later in Woof!, and so they're not listed here anymore.

Most of Nugget Doom's features come from other sources, like source ports and mods;
the initial implementations for some are **ported from (p.f.)** said sources, while others are just **inspired by (i.b.)** them.
These acknowledgements are included in the feature lists below; be aware that some might be inaccurate or outright missing.

A few settings are labeled as **_CFG-Only_**: they can only be toggled by editing `nugget-doom.cfg`.
For these settings, their CVAR names are provided alongside the _CFG-Only_ label as guidance.

# Releases

Source code and Windows binaries (MSVC builds for Windows 7 and newer) for the latest release can be found on the [Release](https://github.com/MrAlaux/Nugget-Doom/releases/latest) page.

The most recent list of changes can be found in the [Changelog](https://github.com/MrAlaux/Nugget-Doom/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).

A complete history of changes and releases can be found on the [Releases](https://github.com/MrAlaux/Nugget-Doom/releases) page.

## Versioning

Nugget Doom follows a fairly simple (albeit arbitrary) **X.Y.Z** versioning system:

- **X** is increased in the event of major implementations, as were arbitrary/dynamic resolution and voxel support;
- **Y** is increased in the event of minor implementations, such as a new cheat;
- **Z** is increased in the event of bug fixes or text/code reformatting.

Incrementing any of the first values will reset the latter (i.e. a major change to 1.1.2 would shift it to 2.0.0).

The merging of changes from Woof! releases may affect any of the version values, but not necessarily in the same way as Woof!'s own version (i.e. `Woof! 11.Y.Z -> 12.Y.Z` doesn't necessarily mean `Nugget 2.Y.Z -> 3.Y.Z`).

# Compiling

As a Woof! fork, its build instructions should also apply here:

The Nugget Doom source code is available at GitHub: <https://github.com/MrAlaux/Nugget-Doom>.

## Linux, and Windows with MSYS2

The following build system and libraries need to be installed:
 
 * [CMake](https://cmake.org) (>= 3.9)
 * [SDL2](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/tree/SDL2) (>= 2.0.18)
 * [SDL2_net](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL_net)
 * [openal-soft](https://github.com/kcat/openal-soft) (>= 1.22.0 for PC Speaker emulation)
 * [libsndfile](https://github.com/libsndfile/libsndfile) (>= 1.1.0 for MPEG support)
 * [fluidsynth](https://github.com/FluidSynth/fluidsynth) (>= 2.2.0, optional)
 * [libxmp](https://github.com/libxmp/libxmp) (optional)
 
Usually your distribution should have the corresponding packages in its repositories, and if your distribution has "dev" versions of those libraries, those are the ones you'll need.

Once installed, compilation should be as simple as:

```
 cd nugget-doom
 mkdir build; cd build
 cmake ..
 make
```

After successful compilation the resulting binary can be found in the `src/` directory.

## Windows with Visual Studio

Visual Studio 2019 and [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) comes with built-in support for CMake by opening the source tree as a folder.

Install vcpkg <https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg#quick-start-windows>. Integrate it into CMake or use toolchain file:
```
 cd nugget-doom
 cmake -B build -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE="[path to vcpkg]/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake"
 cmake --build build
```
CMake will automatically download and build all dependencies for you.
