Description             : It was an unfortunate coincidence that you ended up
                          here. ZX-27 Outpost...
                          
                          An infamous place that has been overrun by
                          archdemons. No one ever came back from ZX-27
                          Outpost.
                          
                          It looks like an ordinary technobase, but being
                          here now and feeling the weight of the local
                          atmosphere, you realize that nothing good awaits
                          you. There is something sinister here, hidden from
                          sight, but watching each of us closely...
