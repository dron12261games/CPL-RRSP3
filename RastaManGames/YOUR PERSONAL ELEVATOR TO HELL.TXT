Description             : Looks like you were forced to use this elevator. It
                          is so slow! At least, the ride itself gonna be very
                          chill and relaxing... Right?
                          
                          Hell nah, dawg! Prepare yourself for the extreme
                          acts of violence in a way to save yourself from the
                          raging Hell pawns.
                          
                          
                          Q: "If this elevator goes to Hell, why does it
                          moving up?"
                          A: "Because Hell is on Earth already!"
