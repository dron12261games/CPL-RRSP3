Copy the IWADs here and make sure the file names are as 
follows:

“DOOM.WAD” or “DOOMU.WAD” or “DOOM1.WAD” for Ultimate Doom.
“DOOM2.WAD” for Doom 2.
“PLUTONIA.WAD” for Plutonia.
“TNT.WAD” for TNT Evilution.
“HERETIC.WAD” for Heretic.
“HEXEN.WAD” for Hexen.



If you don't have IWADs, you can buy the game from Steam 
or GOG and find the appropriate IWADs in the game folders.

We recommend using IWADs from the original DOS releases, 
but technically IWADs from the Unity port (2019 Re-Release) 
and from the BFG Edition can work too.
