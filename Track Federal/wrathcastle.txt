Description             : The map is using Minicharge by Tango. Map inspired by the second
                          episode of Perditions Gate.

                          Today's gimmick is parkour! There's a little bit of variation 
                          in the routing here, but you can go through the level in different
                          ways, all rooms except the arenas have multiple entrances.

                          Plus the map uses the Minicharge mod as a resource, making gameplay 
                          faster than vanilla doom.
