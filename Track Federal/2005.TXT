Title                   : 2005
Filename                : 2005.wad
Release date            : 27.04.24
Author                  : Track Federal

Description             : I wanted to do something nostalgic, in the spirit
                          of the 2000s. Besides the wads of the decade, I
                          took inspiration from Valiant. I don't have much
                          else to add, except that the map is made for
                          different difficulties, although it's still pretty
                          easy.
